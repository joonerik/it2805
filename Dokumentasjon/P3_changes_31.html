                <h2>Our client: Morten Butangen</h2>
                <p>Our client Morten Butangen wants to promote the new restaurant for students and people on the go. It’s called “Samspiseriet” and will help students not worry about the problems related to making and buying food. Instead he thinks students should be able to enjoy food without feeling like it’s a burden. He also sees the importance of earning enough money to keep the restaurant alive. Therefore he wants a webpage for quick and easy promotion, and at the same time have services that makes the customers happy.</p>

                <h2>Purpose and goal</h2>
                <p>The purpose of the site is to offer potential customers a contact- and promoting point for the restaurant. The site should include menus, contact information, the ability to book a table, and a general description of the restaurant. It should showcase the interior and exterior of the restaurant, and provide photos of meals offered. 
                    Our client wants to provide the customers a quick, healthy and affordable meal, also having take-away as an option. Located in Trondheim, and only one block away from X makes this goal very much achievable, according to our client.

                <h2>Audience</h2>
                <p>The main appeal of the restaurant will be affordable, healthy, and quick meals. The audience will therefore probably turn out to be students, and other people that desire a quick and healthy meal. Most customers will be young, and therefore the website must be compatible with phones or smaller screens. </p>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>As we expect a lot of customers to use their phone on the go, we need to keep in mind how much data is needed to load a certain page, especially the home page. Photos will be important to showcase the different and broad specter of meals, but they also require the most data. We will need to find a smooth solution on this problem. One suggestion is not having photos on the menu page, but maybe in a pdf-format. 
                    Our goal as a team is to use mainly HTML and CSS. We might face some issues regarding ordering takeout or/and table reservation only using Javascript. Although we want to focus on the HTML and CSS part, the team is expecting to be in the need of JavaScript for a few different implementations.
